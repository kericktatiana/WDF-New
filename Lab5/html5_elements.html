		<h1>HTML5 Elements and my life</h1>
			<p>Hello, I'm here to talk about how amazing my freaking life it and how I will tie all of this into <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements.</p>

		<h2>Basic Information</h2>
		I've moved like 7 times in my life, and surpsinging only 2 of those moves was to a completely new location. I <del>used</del> to live in the deep fiery pits of hell but in the 1800's I escaped those doors to come to <del>earth</del> Nu Hell</p>
		
		<p>In times like these if one needed to contact me they would <b>email</b> me at <address>Miss_Tati_K@yahoo.com</address><p>
		
		<p>But back in those years before the computer I would open the mail box to my castle at <address> Castle Dracula, Transylania, Romania, Europe</address></p>

		<p>But enough of my history, if you would like to know more by all means click away at the area below</p>

	<h2> Magick and Wonder</h2>

				<p>Daughter of Satan himself, queen of the dragons, ruler of the underworld after the reing of the evil one himself. Fought battles with <i>Gaints, vampires, the Crusaids</i></p>
		</details>

		<p>If you like to know how I did that little magick trick that only works on <ins>Google Chrome</ins> follow the code below <br />
		
		<pre>
			<code>
			&lt;details&gt;
				&lt;summary&gt;The text you want the <dfn title="a person who is sitting on the computer using the website you made">user</dfn> to click.&lt;summary&gt;
			&lt;details&gt;
			</code>
		</pre>
		</p>

		<p>Yes there is a &lt;dfn&gt; tag up there</p>

		<p>Right now it is <time>6:00 PM</time> on <time datetime="2012 06-7">this fabulous day.</time> But firefox doesn't support the &lt;time&gt; tag but its there, it is in the code.</p>
		<br />

		<p>Everytime I hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> and <kbd>s</kbd> this beautiful pages updates and looks even better every time I hit <kbd>fn</kdb> and <kdb>f5</kdb> to refresh the page, its just for beauty you get to see.</p>

	<h2>Now its time for some math</h2>
		<p>This wonderful little section includes &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;, &lt;var&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;, and &lt;dfn&gt;

		<p>I would like to point out that I took both of my Full Sail math classes online and <mark>without a book</mark> and still got an <meter value=”70” min=”0” max=”100” low=”40” high=”90” optiumum=”100”>A.</meter>(there is a meter tag in there)</p>

		<p>Its been about 7 months since I took those classes and I've yet to fine a used for <samp><var>8</var>yx<sup>2</sup>*<var>9</var>b<sup>3</sup></samp><p>
		<p>It's also been about 2 and a half years since my last <b>Science</b> class and the only use I have for <dfn title="Hydrogen Peroxide">H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></dfn> is that its recomended to have around when you have a lot of metal coming out of your body</p>
