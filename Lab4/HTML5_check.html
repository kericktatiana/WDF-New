		<h1><a name="euro"><a href="http://iloveeurostile.com/">Eurostile</a></h1>
			<img src="Images/eurostile.png" width="720" height="450"/>
			<p>This is a campaign site for a font called Eurostile. Though this design is utilizing the advantages of HTML5, there are still a couple of mistakes lurking around.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The HTML document itself is a bit messy and hard to read</li>
				<li>The first couple of sections are names, the rest remain to be untitled, to fix this you would go into your sections, divs, articles, etc. to add titles.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1><a name="conect"><a href="http://www.conectabalear.com/en/">Conecta Balear</a></h1>
			<img src="Images/conecta.png" width="720" height="450" />
			<p>This is an Europe based sites for connecting computers through wifi. The designer of this page knew about the HTML5 structure so the only thing wrong with the outline is that the navigation is being considered an untitled section, to fix that you would just assign a class name to the navigation tag.</p>

		<h1><a name="mouse"><a href="http://mousewillplay.co.uk/">Mouse Will Play</a></h1>
			<img src="Images/mouse.png" width="720" height="450">
			<p>This is a portfolio site of a web designer showing off the sites he created and the services he can offer. This designer's code unlike the pervious sites is really clean and easy to read. Unfortunately most of the sections are untitled, the simple fix for that is to go into the code and assign titles.</p>

		<h1><a name="bug"><a href="http://www.badbugs-shirts.com/">Bad Bug T-shirts</a></h1>
			<img src="images/bad-bug.png" width="720" height="450">
			<p>This last sites is an online store for some awesome looking shirts with amazing clean code, and some comments left for the designer to follow (I'm a little jealous). with only one untitled section which can easily be fixed.</p>
