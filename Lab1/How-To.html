	<h3>Your Character</h3>
		<p>So, you want to be a pirate? Well before we can join a crew and jump on a ship we need to figure out what kind of pirate you wish to be. Because you are creating a fictional character your options are basically limitless and ideal can be found in the strangest of places. Are you a ruthless captain feared by all, and loved by none? Or is the touch a women to tempting for the likes of you? Are you the thief of lady's hearts, or a doggy whale? Perhaps you are a woman of the sea, part of the crew and treated like a man. Or a lady of the land waiting for ships to make their stops and have yourself a good time. Are you in it for the gold? The drink? The sea? Or the freedom of not having to follow any rules but your own.</p>
		<P>All of these attributes are an important part of developing your character, after all you are creating a new personality for yourself. Certain characteristics are necessary for a personality how you act need to come from some where for example in your a lusty fellow you either have lots of gold, or your looks speak for themselves. If you're a ruthless and fearful captain why are you so feared?</p>
		<p>Create a story for yourself. Explain how you became a pirate, were you recruited or is this the life for you? Where have you traveled to, where do you plan to go? What were some of your adventures? What kind of treasure are you after, or have found? Every pirate has a story and every story needs to be a good one. Run your imagination wild.</p>
		
		<h3>Where is your character from?</h3>
		<p> Home is the foundation on which the rest of your life is built upon, and your roots also play an important part of personality. Where your from is a really big deal, provides an explanation for some of those quirks your will often have. This is also a huge part in your appearance and if your are of a different race, this is an advantage you have. No two pirates are the same and different ethnicity separate those lines dramatically. Certain pirate have certain traditions and some can intertwine with your current traditions, better stories come from what you know the best.</p>
		<p>Here are a few example of different types of pirates</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Spanish</li>
			<li>Russian</li>
			<li>British</li>
			<li>English</li>
			<li>Asian</li>
			<li>African</li>
			<li>Jamaican</li>
			<li>Hungarian</li>
			<li>Italian</li>
			<li>Polish</li>
			<li>And many, many more</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Where you are from also dictates the sound of your voice, your accent. This plays a rather important roll for your character's personality. You can't just play a pirate with a cheap english accent, but you also can't use your regular voice either. Take some time to research different accents and see what you prefer, or what you can pull off. Keep in mind that the more of a personality that you create, the better. (this prevents any Jeckle and Hyde accidents)
		
		<h3>What does your character look like?</h3>
		<p>You're characters appearance is more based on your current appearance, such has skin color, hair, gender (or which ever you prefer), and the way your body looks. There is not right or wrong appearance, these are standards that you are creating for yourself. But don't go to lengths to create a permanent pirate look (unless you are really dedicated). Do not harm yourself for the sake of your fictional character, we have the advantages of prosthetics for scars, cuts, wounds, and of course make up for what else you so desire.</p>
		<p>Being I pirate, captain, wench, or lady you need to think of what your character would wear. Keep in mind that this is something that will define you from the outside even before you speak your title. Clothing needs to be of the proper time, heritage, and use. These will be considered costumes but once you put them on, and bring out your other personality these are your clothes and nothing more.</p>
		<h3>Do what ye will, like, and need. Give nothing back.</h3>
		<p>You are a pirate now. You are a dog to the sea, and lover of drink, women, power, and gold. You live your morals has your own laws, nothing will tame you and you are free. This is a personality that comes and goes when you please, after all this is a fictional character you created.</p>
