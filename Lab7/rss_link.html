<h1>Freddy</h1>

<p>This movie didn't meet it's expectation. Becuase of the age different since the last movie every one was expecting not only a ranchy script but better effects along with the story line. 3/5</p>

<h1>SLC Punk</h1>

<p>SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies that the main stream has kind of ruined due to the fact that come the end every one basically sold out. Punk is for live, but I do enjoy the journey these punks go through. 4/5</p>

<h1>Addams Family</h1>

<p>Another one of my favorite movies, I grew up watching the black and white series. The directors kept the same witty, dark humor like the show with a captivating story line. 5/5</p>

<h1>Hocus Pocus</h1>

<p>Yet, another favorite movie of mine. Witches from the past are brought to the furture through a spell where they try to make themselves imortal and haunt the children for all eternity. Unfortunaly like all disney movies the good rides over evil and the witches die. 4.5</p>
